        <p v-t="'PacketFence integrates with many 3rd party solutions. Among the solutions, there are:'"></p>
        <dl>
            <dt v-t="'Firewall SSO:'"></dt> <dd>This allows PacketFence to let the firewall know who is using a particular IP address on the network. The firewall can then apply per-user or per-role policies.</dd>
            <dt v-t="'Cisco Mobility Services Engine:'"></dt> <dd>This provides PacketFence geographical location information of endpoints on the network. You can then provide a different captive portal based on where the device is physically located, or position an endpoint on a specific map of a building.</dd>
            <dt v-t="'Web Services:'"></dt> <dd>This allows PacketFence to expose some of its APIs through Web Services. See the PacketFence Developers Guide for API documentation.</dd>
            <dt v-t="'Syslog Parsers:'"></dt> <dd>PacketFence can receive security event information from multiple solutions over syslog. You can configure which data input you want to accept from this module.</dd>
            <dt v-t="'WRIX:'"></dt> <dd>This allows PacketFence to define Wireless Roaming Intermediary eXchange (WRIX) information on access points it manages.</dd>
