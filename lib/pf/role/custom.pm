=head2 shouldAutoRegister

This is an example of how to redefine a method for custom purposes.

See pf::role::shouldAutoRegister for full original method.

=cut

#sub shouldAutoRegister{
#    #$mac is MAC address
#    #$switch_in_autoreg_mode is set to 1 if switch is in registration mode
#    #$security_event_autoreg is set to 1 if called from a security_event with autoreg action
#    #$isPhone is set to 1 if device is considered an IP Phone.
#    #$conn_type is set to the connnection type expressed as the constant in pf::config
#    #$user_name is set to the RADIUS User-Name attribute (802.1X Username or MAC address under MAC Authentication)
#    #$ssid is set to the wireless ssid (will be empty if radius and not wireless, undef if not radius)
#    my ($self, $mac, $switch_in_autoreg_mode, $security_event_autoreg, $isPhone, $conn_type, $user_name, $ssid, $eap_type, $switch, $port, $radius_request) = @_;
#
#    my $logger = get_logger();
#    # CUSTOM: We want to auto-register 802.1x connections
#    # Since they already have validated credentials through EAP to do 802.1X
#    if (defined($conn_type) && (($conn_type & $EAP) == $EAP)) {
#        $logger->trace("returned yes because it's a 802.1X client that successfully authenticated already");
#        return 1;
#    }
#    # \CUSTOM
#
#    # Otherwise, call parent method
#    return $self->SUPER::shouldAutoRegister($mac, $switch_in_autoreg_mode, $security_event_autoreg, $isPhone, $conn_type, $user_name, $ssid, $eap_type, $switch, $port, $radius_request);
